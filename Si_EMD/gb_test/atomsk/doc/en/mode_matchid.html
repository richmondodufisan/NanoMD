<h2>Mode: match-id</h2>

<h4>Syntax</h4>

<p><code>atomsk --match-id &#60;file1&#62; &#60;file2&#62; [options] [&#60;outputfile&#62;] [&#60;formats&#62;]</code></p>


<h4>Description</h4>

<p>This mode reads two files, and attempts to sort atoms from &#60;file2&#62; in the same order as atoms from &#60;file1&#62;. The two files may be in different formats as long as these formats are <a href="./formats.html">supported by Atomsk</a>. Both files shall correspond to the same system (i.e. same atom types, same lattice, etc.) for the computation to make sense.</p>

<p>If both files contain exactly the same number of atoms, then Atomsk creates unique pairs of atoms from &#60;file1&#62; and &#60;file2&#62;.</p>

<p>If the two files contain different numbers of atoms, then atoms from the &#60;file1&#62; are paired to those from &#60;file2&#62; in an injective way, i.e. so that each atom from &#60;file1&#62; is paired at maximum with only one atom from &#60;file2&#62;. If &#60;file1&#62; contains fewer atoms, then some atoms from &#60;file2&#62; will not be paired, and will appear at the end of the list in the final file. Atomsk then creates a new auxiliary property named "new_atoms", equal to zero for all atoms that were paired, and to 1 for atoms that could not be paired (i.e. atoms that were added when going from &#60;file1&#62; to &#60;file2&#62;). If &#60;file1&#62; contains the most atoms, then all atoms from &#60;file2&#62; should be paired and sorted accordingly. The final file will contain as many atoms as the &#60;file2&#62;.</p>

<p>If shells (in the sense of an ionic core-shell model) and/or auxiliary properties exist in both systems, then they are also sorted so that each atom keeps its properties</p>

<p>If you use this mode with one or several <a href="./options.html">options</a>, then these options will be applied on the final file <em>after</em> atoms are sorted.</p>



<h4>Examples</h4>

<ul>
<li><code class="command">atomsk --matchid config1.cfg config2.xsf final.cfg</code>
<p>This will read <code>config1.cfg</code> and <code>config2.xsf</code>, and sort atoms from <code>config2.xsf</code> so that they are in the same order as in <code>config1.cfg</code>. The final result will be written in <code>final.cfg</code>.</p></li>
</ul>
