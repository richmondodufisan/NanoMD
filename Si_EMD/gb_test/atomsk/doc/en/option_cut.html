<h2>Option: cut</h2>

<h4>Syntax</h4>

<p><code>-cut &#60;above|below&#62; &#60;d&#62; &#60;normal&#62;</code></p>


<h4>Description</h4>

<p>This option allows to "cut" a system, i.e. remove atoms that are above or below a given plane.</p>

<p>The parameters for this option are the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>above|below</strong>: this keyword decides if it is the atoms above or below the plane that are removed.</li>
  <li><strong>d</strong>: distance from the origin of the axis where the cut plane is placed, in angstr&ouml;ms (&Aring;).</li>
  <li><strong>normal</strong>: direction perpendicular to the plane of cut; can be x, y, z, or a crystallographic direction (see below).</li>
</ul>

<p>The position &#60;d&#62; is usually given in &Aring;. It is also possible to give it with respect to the box dimensions with the keyword BOX and an operation (see <a href="./box.html">this page</a>).</p>

<p>The &#60;normal&#62; can be one of 'x', 'y', 'z' (referring to cartesian axes), or a crystallographic direction defined by its Miller indices [<em>hkl</em>], or [<em>hkil</em>] for hexagonal systems (see <a href="./options.html">how to specify Miller indices</a>). If the crystallographic orientation of the system is defined (e.g. through the <a href="./option_properties.html">option <code>-properties</code></a>) then the Miller indices are considered with respect to that orientation. Otherwise the orientation assumed is X=[100], Y=[010], Z=[001].</p>

<p>If some atoms have shells (in the sense of an ionic core-shell model), it is the position of the core that is compared to &#60;d&#62;. When an atom is removed, both its core and shell (and auxiliary properties if any) are removed.</p>

<p>If a selection was defined (with the <a href="./option_select.html">option <code>-select</code></a>) then only the selected atoms are removed.</p>

<p>Note that this option does not change the supercell parameters. In other words, it results in a void region where atoms have been removed.</p>


<h4>Default</h4>

<p>By default the system is not cut.</p>


<h4>Examples</h4>

<ul>
<li><code class="command">atomsk system.gin -cut above 0.5*BOX z xsf</code>
<p>This will read the file <code>system.gin</code>, and delete all atoms that are above the plane placed at half the height along Z. The result will be output to the file <code>system.xsf</code>.</p></li>

<li><code class="command">atomsk initial.gin -cut below 2.4 x -cut above 40 x final.xyz</code>
<p>This will read the file <code>initial.gin</code>, delete all atoms that have an X coordinate smaller than 2.4 &Aring; or greater than 40 &Aring;. The result will be output in the file <code>final.xyz</code>.</p></li>

<li><code class="command">atomsk final.xyz -cut below 2.4 x initial.gin -cut above 40 x</code>
<p>Same as the previous example. Note that each option must be followed by its parameters, but input and output files can be placed in any order.</p></li>

<li><code class="command">atomsk final.xyz -cut below 14 [011] initial.gin -cut above 40 [1-10]</code>
<p>This will read the file <code>initial.gin</code>, delete all atoms that are closer than 14 &Aring; along the [011] direction, and those more far away than 40 &Aring; along [1<span class="over">1</span>0].</p></li>

<li><code class="command">atomsk final.xyz -cut above 40 [1-210] initial.gin -cut above 40 [1-10]</code>
<p>This example illustrates the use of Miller indices for hexagonal systems. In this case, atoms that are above 40&nbsp;&Aring; along the [1<span class="over">2</span>10] direction will be deleted.</p></li>
</ul>
