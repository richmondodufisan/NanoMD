<h2>Mode: radial distribution function</h2>

<h4>Syntax</h4>

<p><code>atomsk --rdf &#60;file&#62; &#60;R<sub>max</sub>&#62; &#60;dR&#62; [options]</code></p>

<h4>Description</h4>

<p>In this mode Atomsk computes the radial distribution function(s) (RDF) for one or several systems.</p>

<p>The analysis is performed for all skins [R;R+dR] with R ranging from 0 up to &#60;R<sub>max</sub>&#62;, and averaged over all atoms (i.e. space-averaged). The maximum radius &#60;R<sub>max</sub>&#62; and the width &#60;dR&#62; of the skin (or shell) must be provided (in &Aring;). The maximum radius &#60;R<sub>max</sub>&#62; can be greater than the system size.</p>

<p>If the &#60;file&#62; contains an atomic system (in one of the <a href="./formats.html">formats supported by Atomsk</a>), then the RDF is computed for this system.</p>

<p>If the &#60;file&#62; contains a list of file names, then the RDF is computed for all of these files, and averaged over all these snapshots, i.e. it is both space- and time-averaged. All files should correspond to the same system (for example, snapshots of a molecular dynamics run) for the calculation to make sense.</p>

<p>If the system contains several atom species then all the partial RDFs are computed. E.g. if atoms A and B exist, then Atomsk will compute the RDF for A atoms around A atoms, B around A, and B around B.</p>

<p>Output consists of the following files (where the &#60;A&#62; and &#60;B&#62; are replaced by the atomic symbols):</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>*_rdf_&#60;A&#62;&#60;B&#62;.dat</strong>: files containing the value of the RDF of atoms B around A as a function of distance.</li>
</ul>

<p>If this mode is used with one or several <a href="./options.html">options</a> they will be applied to the system <em>before</em> computing the RDF.</p>


<h4>Performance</h4>

<p>This mode relies on a neighbor search algorithm, which admittedly was not optimized in Atomsk. The time required for neighbor search increases linearly with the volume (i.e. as R<sup>3</sup>). Therefore it is advised to use a value of R<sub>max</sub> as small as possible, typically between 10 and 20&nbsp;&Aring;. To save computational time, the neighbour list is rebuilt only if the maximum displacement of an atom exceeds the value of &#60;dR&#62;. After that, the time required for computing the RDF itself increases linearly with the step dR and with the number of particles.</p>



<h4>Examples</h4>

<ul>
<li><code class="command">atomsk --rdf aluminium.cfg 10 0.1</code>
<p>This will compute the radial distribution function for the system <code>aluminium.cfg</code>, from 0 to 10&nbsp;&Aring;, using a shell width dR=0.1&nbsp;&Aring;.</p></li>

<li><code class="command">atomsk --rdf list.lst 10 0.1</code>
<p>This will compute the radial distribution function for all systems in <code>list.lst</code>, from 0 to 10&nbsp;&Aring;, using a shell width dR=0.1&nbsp;&Aring;.</p></li>

</ul>
