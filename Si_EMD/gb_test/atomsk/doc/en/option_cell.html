<h2>Option: cell</h2>

<h4>Syntax</h4>

<p><code>-cell &#60;add|rm|set&#62; &#60;d&#62; &#60;H1|H2|H3|x|y|z|xy|xz|yx|yz|zx|zy|xyz&#62;</code></p>


<h4>Description</h4>

<p>This option allows to modify the cell vectors.</p>

<p>It is possible to add, remove, or set a given length &#60;d&#62; to the provided component(s) of the cell.</p>

<p>Keywords H1, H2, H3 refer to the three box vectors. Adding a distance &#60;d&#62; to a cell vector means that it will keep the same direction, but its norm will be longer by &#60;d&#62;. The same logic applies for removing (rm) or setting (set) the distance.</p>

<p>Keywords x, y, z, refer to the Cartesian components of cell vectors. Adding a distance &#60;d&#62; to the x component, means that the cell vector with the largest component along X will be rescaled so that the "bounding box" (difference between maximum and minimum coordinates along X) will be longer by &#60;d&#62;. Cell vectors will keep their respective directions and relative angles. Note that if cell vectors are inclined with respect to Cartesian axes, then their length is not modified by &#60;d&#62; but by another amount. The component "xyz" means that the same distance &#60;d&#62; will be added (or removed) to all Cartesian components. The components xy, xz, yx, yz, zx, zy are non-diagonal elements of the cell vectors matrix.</p>

<p>Note that if cell vectors are aligned with Cartesian axis, such that H1//x, H2//y, and H3//z, then using "H1" is equivalent to using "x", because H1 only has a non-zero component along x. The same is true for H2 and y, and for H3 and z.</p>

<p>The distance &#60;d&#62; must be given in angstr√∂ms (&Aring;), and should be positive to avoid confusion. Using "add" with a negative value of &#60;d&#62; will actually reduce the length of a box vector. Similarly, using "rm" with a negative value of &#60;d&#62; will increase the vector length.</p>

<p>The Cartesian positions of atoms are not modified by this option. Therefore, elongating a box vector (with "add" or "set") will introduce a void region along the given direction. Inversely, if a box vector is reduced (with "rm" or "set"), then atoms may end up out of the box.</p>

<p>In order to specify all cell vectors components, it is possible to write them into a file and use the <a href="./option_properties.html">option <code>-property</code></a>. To force Atomsk to construct automatically a bounding box, one may use the <a href="./option_rebox.html">option <code>-rebox</code></a>.</p>


<h4>Default</h4>

<p>By default Atomsk uses the cell vectors read from the input file. If no cell vectors are found in the input file, then a warning is displayed and the <a href="./option_rebox.html">option <code>-rebox</code></a> is automatically called after reading the file (and before applying any other option). For instance, this is the case with the <a href="./format_xyz.html">default XYZ format</a> which does not contain any box vector.</p>



<h4>Examples</h4>

<ul>
<li><code class="command">atomsk initial.cfg -cell add 10 H2 final.cfg</code>
<p>With this command, Atomsk will read the file <code>initial.cfg</code>, and then add 10&nbsp;&Aring; to the second cell vector (H2). In other words, the second cell vector will keep the same direction, but will be 10&nbsp;&Aring; longer. Atom positions will remain the same, so this will add "void" along that direction. The result will be output in <code>final.cfg</code>.</p></li>

<li><code class="command">atomsk initial.cfg -cell add 20 y final.cfg</code>
<p>This will read the file <code>initial.cfg</code> and add 20&nbsp;&Aring; to the cell length along the Cartesian Y axis. In practice this is equivalent to adding void along the Y direction. The result will be output in <code>final.cfg</code>.</p></li>

<li><code class="command">atomsk initial.cfg -cell set 87.4 H1 final.cfg</code>
<p>This will change the length of the first box vector to 87.4&nbsp;&Aring;.</p></li>

<li><code class="command">atomsk initial.cfg -cell rm 0.5 H3 final.cfg</code>
<p>This will reduce the length of the third box vector by 0.5&nbsp;&Aring;.</p></li>
</ul>
